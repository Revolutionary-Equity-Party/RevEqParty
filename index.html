            <p>The Revolutionary Equity Party is a organization focused on the education and
 organization of currently unenfranchized people into revolutionary and antifascist mass 
 organization. We lead a weekly study group focused on teaching the basics of Marxist
 and anarchist revolutionary theory and practice. Some of our party's goals include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Demystifying newer folks of the left.</li>
                <li>Turning broad ideals into specific actions to change the current state of things.</li>
                <li>Creating class consciousness in liberal spaces.</li>
                <li>Providing a platform to voice the opinion of the people.</li>
            </ul>
