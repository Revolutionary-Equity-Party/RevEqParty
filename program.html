            <p>Revolutionary Equity Part, as a progressive organization; the following three values are the core of our membership:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anti-capitalism</li>
                <li>Anti-imperialism</li>
                <li>Anti-prejudice</li>
            </ul>
            These are practically simple demands, but ought to be clarified into actionable policies:

            <span class="article-title">~Anti-Capitalism~</span>
            <p>Imperialism, namely the American domination of a majority of the world using both economic and
                military coercion must end. While we can study many struggles, our focus is on imperialism , particularly
                the United States, as members of the working class here specifically. Our goals include the liberation of
                Palestine and the Philippines from occupation, the withdrawal of US forces from across the world, ending
                the Blockade on Cuba and Venezuela, and self determination for those imprisoned and oppressed within
                the US, namely Blacks, Native Americans, Chicanos, Puerto Ricans, Hawaiians, and Arab and Muslim
                Americans.</p>

            <span class="article-title">~Anti-Prejudice~</span>
            <p>We stand against all forms of prejudice in the equity party, based on Race, Gender, Sexual
                orientation, Disability, Neurodivergence, Capabilities in a particular field, and Origin. This means not only
                not only to oppose discrimination, but to actively practice continual internal and external struggle to fight
                prejudice wherever it may hide. Prejudice doesn't simply fall from the sky, it is a creation of unequal
                economic systems, and many of us were taught it since birth- our standard as a party is not to expel those
                who share incidental prejudices, but to teach those who want to learn, and distance ourselves from those
                who don't. No one is above learning and critique on such grounds.</p>

            <span class="article-title">~Our Leadership~</span>
            <p>These points of unity will be put into practice through Democratic Centralism, or in plain English,
                “Suggestion-Box Democracy”, in which all members have a voice, and trained Cadres have a vote. While
                there will be freedom of debate (provided it's within the confines of the points of unity), our party, like any
                effective party, will have Unity of action. This means, that regardless of our position on a political policy,
                should it be decided on by our peers and be reasonable, we will execute it to the best of our ability.
                <br>
                On a final note, Our party was founded on the embers of an organization created on, and torn apart by,
                personalistic leadership, and petty interpersonal disagreements. Through genuine education, critique and
                self critique, comradery and mutual militancy, we can and will overcome these squabbles, to help build
                real progress in the United States.</p>
